# Pong
This is a sample Unity project to demonstrate basic game interactions, code, and project structure. This version includes a singleplayer mode, in which the objective is to keep a ball in play for as long as possible, and a 2-player mode, in which players attempt to get the ball past the other player's paddle.

Users can play Pong by downloading and extracting the latest release for their platform in Releases.

# Contributing
This project can be built with any recent version of Unity 2022.3, currently we build with 2022.3.55f1. Forks, modifications, and pull requests are welcome. Pull requests and issues should maintain some minimum standards for cordiality, we adhere to the LLVM Code of Conduct at https://llvm.org/docs/CodeOfConduct.html.

# Building
For those unfamiliar with the Unity workflow, begin by downloading Unity from their website and following the installation wizard steps. Be sure to install Unity 2022.3 and not Unity 6, which is an entirely different engine and has been made the default for unknowable reasons.

Once Unity is installed and the correct version of the editor is loaded, clone the source code of this repository, extract, and add the project folder to the hub to begin making edits. Standalone builds can be created via File->Build and Run or CTRL+B.
